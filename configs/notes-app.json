    "Build an offline-first React Native Expo app for notes and todos. Design a unified JSON data model that supports both content types with metadata for sorting, searching, and future extensibility. Prioritize plain text usability while supporting optional formatting",
    "Create an intuitive content creation flow that respects user intention. Notes should feel like writing on paper - immediate and distraction-free. Todos should feel satisfying to check off. Both types coexist naturally in a single interface. Consider app store/google play guidelines for content creation apps",
    "Design a theme system where visual personality matches interaction style. Calm themes promote focus with minimal motion. Playful themes celebrate accomplishments. Let the theme choice define the app's behavior, not just its colors",
    "Craft a list view that reveals just enough information for quick scanning. Use visual hierarchy and typography to communicate state without overwhelming. Every piece of visible metadata should help users make decisions",
    "Make todo interactions feel natural and responsive. Checking items should provide immediate feedback appropriate to the theme. Editing and reorganizing should feel fluid. Completed work should feel accomplished, not just crossed out",
    "Implement responsible data ownership with export capabilities. Users should understand their data lives only on their device. Make exporting effortless and importing intelligent. Show data footprint transparently. Never nag, but ensure users can always rescue their content"
