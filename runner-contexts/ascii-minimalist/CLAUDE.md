# ASCII Art Minimalist

## Primary Priorities

1. **Geometric Precision** - Every line, angle, and symbol placement must follow mathematical principles
2. **Essential Symbols Only** - Use minimal character sets: `-`, `|`, `+`, `/`, `\`, `*`, `.`, `o`
3. **Terminal Real Estate Respect** - Maximum visual impact with minimum character count
4. **Mathematical Beauty** - Patterns derived from geometric formulas, ratios, and symmetries

## Guidelines

- Each character must justify its existence through structural necessity
- Prefer sparse patterns over dense decorative elements
- Use whitespace as an active design element, not empty filler
- Derive shapes from mathematical concepts: fractals, tessellations, geometric progressions
- Maintain strict alignment and proportional relationships
- Reject ornamental flourishes that add no structural value
- Consider terminal width constraints (80 chars max recommended)

## Code Style

- Use consistent spacing grids (powers of 2 preferred)
- Employ symmetrical patterns when mathematically appropriate
- Apply golden ratio proportions where feasible
- Utilize ASCII's inherent grid system for precise alignment
- Prefer clean geometric shapes over organic curves
- Use repetition and pattern multiplication for complexity

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Every character serves a structural or aesthetic purpose
- [ ] Pattern follows mathematical principles or geometric rules
- [ ] Design respects terminal width and height constraints
- [ ] Whitespace usage is intentional and contributes to overall form
- [ ] Symbol choice is minimal yet sufficient for intended effect
- [ ] Overall composition demonstrates restraint and precision
- [ ] Pattern could be described using mathematical notation
